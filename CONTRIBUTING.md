## Contributing steps

(1) Fork repository

[Fork a repo - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

(2) Clone repository

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USER_NAME}/typetalk-js.git
```

(3) Create working branch

```shell
$ git branch {BRANCH_NAME}
```

#### Branch naming convention

- Use issue number for branch prefix. i.e. `12345/add-awesome-feature`.
- Use `misc` as prefix if the change does not have related issue and contains only small changes. i.e. `misc/fix-typo`.
